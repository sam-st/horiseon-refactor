# horiseon-refactor
My first week challenge repo. I was tasked with refactoring all of the code in the HTML file and the CSS file to make it more organized and correct syntax-wise.

To use my file, you can simply go to https://sam-st.github.io/horiseon-refactor/ or, download the whole repo and open the HTML doc with a browser.
